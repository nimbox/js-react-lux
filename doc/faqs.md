## What are atoms and molecules in this project?

**Atoms** are very basic things: a button, a text, a dropdown, an input field. Generally they do not have any operability, but there may be some that do. The "show me more" button has a functionality, but it is still an element that could be used in "any application".

When we talk about an excerpt we are talking about things that are particular to our application. The double form of note and task is also very particular to our application (although perhaps less so). These are two examples of **molecules**.
Obviously there are molecules that can be very complex, with tabs, different views, several toolbars ... Those are already mega molecules.
Perhaps a good distinction is that if it can be used in other applications than nimbox it is an atom, if it is something particular to our applications it is a molecule.
