# ChooseOptionList

Component to choose from a list of options. When an option is clicked the
`onChoose` callback is called with the option. Treat this component as an
unstyled `div`.

This component does not handle asynchronous loading of options, but the
`useSearchOptions` hook can be used to handle this.

This component does not handle keyboard navigation, but the
`useOptionsKeyNavigator` hook can be used to handle this.

The options are be provided in groups, so in the usual case, an array with the
array of options is required (note the double brackets at the begining and the
end): 

```js
[[ 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red' ]]
[[ 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red' ], [ 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange' ]]
```

<Primary />

## Inputs

The component accepts the following inputs (props):

<Controls />

## Data Structure

This component assumes that options come in groups.If you don't want groups, 
you need to create one group with your options.Hence the basic data structure 
would be:

```js
const colors = [['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red']];
```

Notice the actual options are inside another array, representing the first
group.Having two or more groups is very simple, just keep adding arrays:

```js
const colors = [['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Purple', 'Orange']];
```

The structure can be enhanced by using objects for groups and options like this:

```js
const colors = [ 
    { 
        name: 'Primary', 
        options: [
            { value: 'ffff00', name: 'Yellow' },
            { value: '0000ff', name: 'Blue' },
            { value: 'ff0000', name: 'Red' }
        ] 
    },
    { 
        name: 'Secondary', 
        options: [
            { value: '00ff00', name: 'Green' },
            { value: '800080', name: 'Purple' },
            { value: 'ffa500', name: 'Orange' }
        ]
    }
];
```

When using these more complete data structures you need to provide one
extractor:

* __`extractor(group)`__: Get the options for the given group.This function
    returns the options associated to the provided group.In our case it would be
  something like`(group) => group.options`.__By default__ this extractor is 
  `(group) => group` which assumes that the options come in an array.

## HTML Structure

The `HTML` structure of `ChooseOptionList` is:

When is empty (undefined or null or empty array):

```html
<div ref={container} className={className}>
    {renderEmpty} <!-- rendered empty -->
<div>
```

When there is at least one option:

```html
<div ref={container} className={className}>
    <div>
        <div> <!-- group -->
            <div> <!-- rendered group label only if present -->
                {renderGroupLabel}
            <div>
            <ul>
                <li> <!-- rendered option -->
                    {renderOption}
                </li>
            <ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Stories

This component only displays the groups, options, and selected option. If there
is `loading` or `loading error` nothing is rendered.

<Stories />
