# ShowTransitions

When you interact with the ShowTransition component by changing the show prop
value, a series of events and state transitions occur to manage the visibility
and animation of the component's content. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens
internally within the component when you set show to true and then to false.

## Setting show to `true`:

1. Initial State Check: When the component's show prop changes to `true`, the
   component checks its current state in a `useLayoutEffect` hook. If the
   component is not already in the process of showing (i.e., not in `MOUNTING`
   or `MOUNTED` state), it proceeds to initiate the show transition.
2. Transition to `MOUNTING`: The state is set to `MOUNTING` using setState. This
   triggers the component to re-render. At this point, the component applies the
   `mountClassName` if show is true and the state is not yet defined, indicating
   the start of the mounting animation.
3. Mounting Animation Begins: The `mountClassName` can define the initial styles
   for the animation (e.g., starting opacity, position, etc.). Because this
   happens quickly, users typically see the animation start from the styles
   defined by `mountClassName`.
4. Animation End and Transition to `MOUNTED`: Once the CSS transition or
   animation completes, an `onTransitionEnd` event is triggered. The component
   handles this event by setting the state to `MOUNTED`, indicating the
   animation has finished, and the content is fully visible. At this stage,
   `showClassName` is applied, showing the content in its final, visible state.

## Setting show to `false`:

1. Check Current State: Upon changing show to `false`, the component again
   checks its current state. If the component is in a state indicating it is
   fully visible or in the process of showing (`MOUNTING` or `MOUNTED`), it
   begins the hide transition.
2. Transition to `UNMOUNTING`: The state is updated to `UNMOUNTING`, triggering
   a re-render. The component then applies `unmountClassName` (or
   `mountClassName` if unmountClassName is not explicitly provided), initiating
   the hiding animation.
3. Unmounting Animation Begins: The `unmountClassName` defines the styles for
   the hide animation (e.g., fading out or sliding away). This is where the
   component begins transitioning out of view according to the CSS definitions
   provided.
4. Completion and State Cleanup: Once the hide animation completes, the
   `onTransitionEnd` event is triggered, and the component responds by setting
   the state back to null. This effectively removes the component's content from
   the DOM or stops applying any transition-related classes, completing the hide
   transition.

## Summary of the Flow

* Show Transition: null -> `MOUNTING` (apply `mountClassName`) -> `MOUNTED`
  (apply `showClassName`).
* Hide Transition: `MOUNTED` -> `UNMOUNTING` (apply `unmountClassName` or
  `mountClassName`) -> null.

This lifecycle ensures that your content is smoothly shown and hidden based on
the show prop, with the component intelligently managing CSS classes to apply
your desired animations.
