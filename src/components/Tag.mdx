It is very cumbersome to create a tag that has text truncated with ellipsis 
because getting the vertical align right is not very easy. It all starts from
the CSS spec:

> The baseline of an 'inline-block' is the baseline of its last line box in 
> the normal flow, unless it has either no in-flow line boxes or if its 
> 'overflow' property has a computed value other than 'visible', in which case 
> the baseline is the bottom margin edge.

Having an inline block with text truncate requires an overflow hidden will yield
an out of vertical align element:

<Canvas of={TagStories.DocumentationInlineBlock} />

The way we are working with is to do a flex container having the truncated
element inside and making the compounded element's baseline be the truncated
text.

<Canvas of={TagStories.DocumentationFlexBlock} />

Adding the delete icon creates a new problem of alignment which we takled by
givign the truncated text a height and line height of `1em`

<Canvas of={TagStories.DocumentationFlexIconBlock} />

The rest is accomplished with horizontal padding and margin, and rounding.

<Canvas of={TagStories.DocumentationFlexIconPaddingBlock} />
