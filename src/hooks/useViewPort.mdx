# Viewport

Use a the viewport hook when requiring the scale of the current window.For this
to work, your root element needs to be wrapped inside `ViewportProvider` that
provides the context with the listener for the rescale event.

```
<ViewportProvider>
    <ApplicationCompoment/>
</ViewPortProvider>
```

This function is debounced with a 250ms wait, but that can be changed with the
`wait` parameter in the`ViewportProvider`
