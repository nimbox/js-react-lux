# TooltipProviders

To get the tooltip provider working you need to wrap your application
with the `TooltipProvider` component. This component will provide the
context for the tooltip to work.

```jsx
<TooltipProvider destinationSelector="#modal" tooltipClassName="max-w-sm text-md">
</TooltipProvider>
```

The `destinationSelector` prop is used to specify the selector of the
element where the tooltip will be rendered. The `tooltipClassName` prop
is used to specify the class name of the tooltip container.

Simple tooltips are taken from `data` elements inside every element. Whenever
there is a `mouseover` (not `mouseenter` since it doesn't bubble up) event on
any element with a `data-tooltip` attribute, the tooltip will be shown. This is
usefull for showing simple and short one liners.

These tooltips are placed using the same `Popper` engine used for posititiong
all other elements.
